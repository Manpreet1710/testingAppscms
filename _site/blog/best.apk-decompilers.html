                        <h1 id="best-apk-decompilers"><strong>Best .apk decompilers</strong></h1>

<p>.apk files are very common for all android users, as they are the very essential part of the whole existence of an app on your smartphone. Sometimes, as a developer you may come across some circumstances where you need to decompile or get the source code of the .apk file for further use; and in this blog post, we are going to discuss the same topic. What are .apk decompilers and What are the Best .apk decompilers out there.</p>

<p>So, first, let’s get to the point of what are the .apk decompilers.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/android-points-2011.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="apk-decompilers-"><strong>.apk decompilers :</strong></h1>

<p>The term decompiler is most commonly applied to a program that translates executable programs into source code which when compiled, will produce an executable program, whose behavior is the same as the original program. It is basically the opposite of a compiler, which takes a source file and makes an executable program. So hence,</p>

<p>.apk decompiler is nothing but a program that can obtain the source codes from the pre-created android programs.</p>

<p>As a Developer or just a curious mind, you may come across some apps or games on the play store that you almost fall in love with, and wonder what could be the amazing source code of the .apk file of that application. And if this is you, the .apk decompilers are made for you!</p>

Of course, there is an exception for this when it comes to online services, but this one is specifically for downloaded versions of .apk decompilers, which most of the peoples prefer to use.</p>
