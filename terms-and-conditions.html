                <b>Entire Agreement:</b> These Terms, read with the Policy, form the complete and final contract between
                the User and the Firm with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other communications,
                representations and agreements (whether oral, written or otherwise) relating thereto.

                <b>Waiver:</b> The failure of either Party at any time to require performance of any provision of these
                Terms shall in no manner affect such Party's right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by
                either party of any breach of these Terms, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more
                instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such breach, or a
                waiver of any other breach of these Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Severability:</b> If any provision/clause of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal or
                unenforceable by any court or authority of competent jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
                enforceability of the remaining provisions/clauses of these Terms shall in no way be affected or
                impaired thereby, and each such provision/clause of these Terms shall be valid and enforceable to the
                fullest extent permitted by law. In such case, these Terms shall be reformed to the minimum extent
                necessary to correct any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, while preserving to the maximum
                extent the original rights, intentions and commercial expectations of the Parties hereto, as expressed
                herein.
