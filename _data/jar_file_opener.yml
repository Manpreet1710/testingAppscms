faqs:
- question: Is the .JAR file and .ZIP file same or different?
  answer: ".JAR and .ZIP are two different file formats; they are not similar at all.
    .JAR file is nothing but the Java Archive file for Java programs whereas .ZIP
    file is just a collection of large files put together for the ease of use."
- question: What to do when the Java extraction doesn't work for a .JAR file?
  answer: We recommend you to make sure you have Java SE installed. If you don't have
    Java SE (the Java Developer Kit) installed, you won't be able to use the "jar"
    extraction command, and that can be the basic reason for the .JAR file to not
    open; now if you are unable to install it, just go for the mentioned method in
    the blogpost.
- question: How can I download the decompression software in the first place?
  answer: You can just google search for your required software with ‘Free download’

- question: Is there any other way for extracting a .JAR file?
  answer: Yes, there is. You can extract a .JAR file using Java too as .JAR files

- question: Can you only extract executable files on PC?

    it’s name you can’t make any changes in it. You can extract it for viewing only
    though.
- question: Are .JAR files only used as Standalone apps?
  answer: Actually, even though .JAR files are those who mainly get used in making
    standalone apps as they are the ‘Java Archives’; they are also used to hold program
    libraries for other apps.
- question: What kind of softwares will be needed for the file viewing after extracting?
  answer: Basically it’s like if they are image files you need an image viewer in
    your device to see it in first place; now similarly according to your file type
    you need to choose inbuilt or externally installed software for your work.
- question: How to extract files in the .JAR file?
  answer: Double click on the .JAR file, a new dialogue box will open select all items
