faqs:
- question: How can we convert class files to Java files?
  answer: JAD, the fast Java Decompiler, is a program that reads one or more Java
    class files and converts them into Java source files which can be compiled again.
    Jad is a 100% pure C++ program and it generally works several times faster than
    decompilers written in Java.
- question: What does a decompiler actually do?
  answer: A decompiler is a computer program that takes an executable file as input,
    and attempts to create a high level source file which can be recompiled successfully.
    It is therefore the opposite of a compiler, which takes a source file and makes
    an executable.
