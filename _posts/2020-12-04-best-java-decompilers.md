# **Best Java Decompilers**

Java decompilers are one of the quite normally used terms in today’s technological world of development. Every new age developer needs one as it is one of the important gears in the programmer lifestyle. Now, as we talk about Java decompilers let’s get to know a little bit more about the term Decompiler itself.

> “The term decompiler is most commonly applied to a program which translates executable programs into source code which when compiled, will produce an executable program, whose behavior is the same as the original program. It is basically the opposite of a compiler, which takes a source file and makes an executable program.”

Sounds too complicated? No worries, just remember that Decompilers are the ones who are going to create source codes for your pre-created programs.

Decompilers are usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and as such, will frequently produce obfuscated code. But, still, decompilers remain an important tool in the reverse engineering of computer software.

Why? How? And How will this benefit you? Well, we will figure out all of this in this blog post, so stay tuned until the end; and let’s jump into our Topic!

## **Java Decompilers :**

Now, Java Decompilers are basically no other than the decompilers designed for the Java language and its users. They relate basically to all the Java programming language work.

They are designed in such a way that it is capable of converting a .class file into a Java source code. In addition, it will not give the exact java source code from which the .class file is generated, which is an advantage.

However, most of the code will be the same. A Java decompiler is considered to be extremely helpful in case you have lost the source code.

You can use a Java decompiler to look into the code of predefined Java classes like HashMap, HashSet, ArrayList, and many more.

You can also find out how Sun/Oracle java developers wrote the java classes which are currently used by billions of devices around the world!! Amazing right?

Today there are many Java Decompilers in the market. Many of them provide offline services; there are also some advanced Java decompiler online software.

Now, for all the dear readers here's bonus information who stick till the end; Getting to know more about decompilers, we should know more about their Installation process, and here is how you can install your Java decompiler on eclipse; check it out...:)

## **Installing Java for Eclipse**

As there is no built-in Java decompiler for Eclipse; during using Java on eclipse we need to use Java decompiler from outside. For that, there are freely available external plugins which can be installed in Eclipse to create a built-in decompilation option. Java Decompiler project is one such plugin. So, In this Post, We’ll list down the steps required to install the JD-Eclipse plugin for your PC.

### _Step 1 – Install JD-Eclipse plugin on your PC_

Open Eclipse and click on Help, go to ‘Install New Software’ In the available software window, now click on the link of ‘Available Software Sites’. In that window click on the ‘Add’ button; A pop-up window will appear.

In the pop-up window, provide any name to the site and paste the update site URL as [http://jd.benow.ca/jd-eclipse/update](http://jd.benow.ca/jd-eclipse/update 'http://jd.benow.ca/jd-eclipse/update') and click on ‘Ok’.

In the Available Software window, select the newly created site from the drop-down and wait. Eclipse will fetch the list of plugins available for installation for that site, where we will find the JD-Eclipse Plugin.

Select all the packages and click Next. Accept the license agreement and click Finish to begin the installation of the plugin.

Restart Eclipse after the installation is finished.

### _Step 2 – Set JD-Eclipse as default class editor_

Now, In the eclipse menu bar click on Window and go to Preferences.

In the Preferences windows, go to General; there click on Editors and select File Associations. In the right pane, select .class without a source as the file type.

In the Associated editors: section below, click on the Add button. In the pop-up window which opens up, select Internal editors and in the list below it, select the Class File Editor and click on the OK button

Select the Class File Editor it is identified by the coffee-cup icon; and click on the Default button. This makes JD-Eclipse the default decompiler for class files without source.

Now, simply double-click on any .class file and JD-Eclipse will decompile it for you. You can also place debug points in the decompiled classes while debugging your applications.

And That’s how you are all set with your Java decompiler Gear on your PC, We hope that this article will help you to choose the best Java decompiler that will suit you and your work style.
