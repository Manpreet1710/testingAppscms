## **Type 1- Using Java Runtime environment on PC**

Now if you do not have it already, make sure you download and install Java Runtime Environment on your PC, as it is essential to run any .JAR file.

Once you download and install this, you can easily run any .JAR file on your PC but keep in mind it is only applicable if the .JAR file you are opening is executable, if it is not then you can simply view this file within the Java Runtime Environment instead.

Now, after this amazing solution if your problem is solved, congratulations on that! But if you are looking for something more convenient for you, let’s move on to our next solution, Type-2.

## **Type 2 - Using Java instead**

If the .JAR file is executable then you can open it using an archive program, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip too. But, if you want to open it in Java, follow the sub-steps given below :

- Right Click on the .JAR file to open the selection menu and click on ‘Open with’.
- When the ‘Open with’ window pops up, select the ‘Browse’ option in there to open the ‘File Explorer’ window.
- Now, find the Java executable file on your computer hard drive that is the java.exe file. A quick tip is a file is often located in the "Program Files\\Java" or "Program Files (x86)\\Java" folder, more like within a possible sub-folder below the Java folder present there.
- Once you find the file, select that java.exe file and click on the ‘OK’ button.

That’s how it is done, now you can get the expected results.

So, by far we have seen 2 quite great ways for running your .JAR file successfully! Now, we hope that by far your problem is solved still, if you want another solution to keep in handy; we will tell you the last Type-3.

## **Type 3- Using Command prompt**

Another very underrated way of opening a .JAR file is using a ‘command prompt’ command for it, it is simply replacing yourfile.jar name with the name of your own JAR file.

The command looks like :

java -jar yourfile.jar

And that’s how you can open a .JAR file using the command prompt.
