            <p>
                Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and
                other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in
                this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
                information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Therefore, although we use
                industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that
                your personally identifiable information or private communications would always remain private. We do
                however assure you that any and all disclosure of your personally identifiable information shall be
                personally intimated to you through an email sent to your provided email address.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any
                third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable
                information may be disclosed:

                <li>
                    External Service Providers: There may be a number of services offered by external service providers
                    that help you use our Platform. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of
                    doing so, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to
                    collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy
                    policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to
                    enforce laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you
                    authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government
                    officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an
                    investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or
                    may expose us or you to legal liability.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</h3>
            Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted at the stage of
            registration, except Email ID and mobile number. An option for facilitating such change shall be present on
            the Platform and such change shall be facilitated by the User. If you change any information, we may or may
            not keep track of your old information. We will not retain in our files information you have requested to
            remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms
            and conditions. Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases, including stored
            ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, or
            to remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the User needs to remediate, and promptly correct any
            such incorrect information.
            </p>
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</h3>
            You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you
            protect it against unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully
            and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services.
            You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another Member at any time or to
            disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
            information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
            control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on
            your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change
            your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your
            account or access to your password even after changing it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">SECURITY</h3>
            We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many
            different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside
            the Firm. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to
            us and information that we have accessed.
            However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. Our Firm cannot
            guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you provide won’t be
            intercepted while being transmitted to the Firm over the Internet.

            from all and any other paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or indicated by the
            context of the agreement. The decision or declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void
            shall have no effect on the remaining paragraphs of this privacy policy.
