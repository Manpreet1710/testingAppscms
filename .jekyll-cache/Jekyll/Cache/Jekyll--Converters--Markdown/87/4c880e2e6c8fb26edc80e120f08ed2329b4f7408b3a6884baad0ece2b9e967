I"b<p>Developing an app is a process, but to make it usable by the global audience is a different game altogether. According to <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/">GSMA Intelligence</a> , there are already more than 4.8 unique mobile users worldwide, and this number is projected to grow up to 5.7 billion by 2020.

A chunk of the mobile users are located in Asia and Pacific regions, and on a global level only around 15% of the users speak English as their first or second language. So, where do these downloads come from?</p>
